# Inbox

An application that can be used to deploy contracts on the Ethereum network.

Thorough testing is done and the contract is compiled and then deployed to the Rinkeby test network.

**This project uses the following dependencies**

"ganache-cli": "^6.0.3",
"mocha": "^5.0.0",
"solc": "^0.4.19",
"truffle-hdwallet-provider": "0.0.3",
"web3": "^1.0.0-beta.26"

Most of these dependencies are going through rapid development.
I encourage you to go through the docs to see which one is compatible and stable at the time you try to use code in this repository.

If you want to check it out, go to the directory where you want to clone it and then:

`git clone https://github.com/rja907/Inbox.git`

`npm install` to install the dependencies.

`npm run test` to run tests.

`node compile.js` to compile the Solidity code.

`node deploy.js` to deploy the Contract on the Rinkeby Test Network.

Let me know what you thought about it!
